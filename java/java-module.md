This module will have all features of Java 8/11/17 versions.


Java 8 introduced several significant features to the language and platform, including:

Lambda Expressions: Lambda expressions enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or to create anonymous inner classes more concisely. They facilitate functional programming in Java.

Streams API: Streams provide a clean and efficient way to process data in collections. They support functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as map-reduce transformations.

Functional Interfaces: Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method. They are used extensively with lambda expressions and method references.

Default Methods: Default methods enable you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. This feature facilitates the evolution of interfaces.

Method References: Method references provide a way to refer to methods or constructors using their names as a shorthand syntax for lambda expressions.

Optional Class: Optional is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It encourages more explicit handling of potentially null values, reducing the likelihood of NullPointerExceptions.

Date and Time API: The new java.time package provides classes for date and time manipulation, offering improved functionality over the previous Date and Calendar classes.

Parallel Array Sorting: The Arrays class now includes parallelSort methods for sorting arrays in parallel, leveraging multi-core processors for faster sorting of large arrays.
